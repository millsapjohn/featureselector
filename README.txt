QGIS FEATURE SELECTOR PLUGIN

Provides keyboard-based selection of features visible in current map pane.

Inspired by vi/vim/neovim, users can bind this command to a keyboard shortcut to select features
without the mouse.

After starting the command, visible features will be labeled with a two-character alphanumberic
temporary name. Typing that name will select the feature. Additionally, features can be filtered
by type using the l (line), p (point), and s (polygon) commands.
